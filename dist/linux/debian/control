Description: Experimental version of cryptomator - Multi-platform cloud encryption.
 vaultXP provides free client-side AES encryption for your cloud files.
 Create encrypted vaults, which get mounted as virtual volumes. Whatever
 you save on one of these volumes will end up encrypted inside your vault.
 This is an experimental fork with additional features.
